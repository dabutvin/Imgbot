Images are one of the key parts of almost any website or application, but they also play a really big role in performance degradation. The more images you have, the slower your load times can become. 

There are a lot of tactics for updating your images to be more performant like cropping and resizing. Imgbot runs a lossless compression to optimize the delivery without sacrificing size or quality. 

With just a couple of clicks, you can get Imgbot running in your project's repo on GitHub and you will see pull requests with your images optimized.

As you continue making further optimizations to the design and delivery of your application, Imgbot will optimize your images the whole time.

Some of Imgbot's core features:

 - GitHub app based permissions
