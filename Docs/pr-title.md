To use an optional custom title for your pull requests, you can set a pull request title for your Imgbot pull requests using the `.imgbotconfig` file.

 - The default title is "[ImgBot] Optimize images".
 - Accepts any string written using [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
 - For paid plans only.
